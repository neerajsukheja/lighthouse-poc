The current execution of BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) scripts requires restarting the entire process from the beginning whenever a step in the script fails. This approach is inefficient, as even if a single step fails, the whole test suite must be re-executed from scratch. Consequently, developers face the following challenges:

    Time Wastage: Each time a failure occurs, the entire BDD script needs to be re-run, leading to significant delays, especially in long test scenarios.

    Redundant Effort: Often, previous steps have already passed successfully, but developers are forced to re-run them repeatedly when a failure occurs in any subsequent step.

    Unpredictable Failures: Even if the test passes after restarting from the beginning, future steps may still fail, causing developers to re-run the process multiple times until all steps pass in a single execution.

    Decreased Productivity: This manual re-execution of scripts hampers the productivity of developers, as they have to continually monitor the test process and intervene frequently to restart it.

To resolve this issue, an enhanced execution mechanism is needed that allows the developer to resume the BDD script from the point of failure without re-running successful steps, thereby reducing execution time, effort, and potential frustration caused by repetitive failures.

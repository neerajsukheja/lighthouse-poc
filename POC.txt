We were waiting for you on the scheduled call today, but it seems you were unable to join. I wanted to follow up on the discussion we were hoping to have during the call.

As I mentioned earlier, I had provided an example of the specific code changes we’re proposing. Just to clarify, this same logic needs to be applied across all files where API calling logic is written, both in the DSM and DBD frameworks.

Regarding the MSW implementation, if you believe that this approach would be simpler to implement, could you please provide an ETA on when it could be available for developers to use? They are currently facing issues while writing BDD tests, and a clearer timeline would help us plan accordingly.

Additionally, I have a couple of questions regarding the MSW approach:

    How will the developers maintain the APIs and mock data? I assume this will be managed at the application level, but could you confirm this?
    Will there be a setting or configuration that allows us to use mock data from MSW in pre-production environments? It would be helpful to know if there’s a provision for this.

Looking forward to your feedback on these points.

1. Serverless API mocking library for Web Application

2. Jenkin Job Optimization
 a. Running test cases concurrently -  Instead of running all tests sequentially, we can use Jest's --maxWorkers option to parallelize the test execution in the same jenkins build.

 b. Node Modules Caching - We can use the "Pipeline Caching" or "workspace caching" to avoid reinstalling dependencies every time the build runs. This can be done by caching the node_modules directory between builds.

3. No-code BDD automation testing for UI and even for BE API's.

4. Automated Dependency Management Tool to streamline the process of managing package updates, resolving vulnerabilities, and ensuring compatibility

5. AI-Driven Refactoring Assistant for enhancing code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity.

Thank you for sharing the updated estimation for story completion. I understand that the previous estimations were not aligning well across different LOBs, and I appreciate the effort in refining the timeline.

However, as per our earlier discussions, I wanted to check if thereâ€™s any possibility to bring down the story completion dates. If the stories extend till mid-September, development would require approximately three more months, which would push production into 2026, considering release activities and testing.

If needed, we can hop on a call to discuss how we can efficiently adjust the plan and explore potential ways to optimize the timeline. Let me know your availability, and we can coordinate accordingly.

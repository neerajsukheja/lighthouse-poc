I hope you are doing well.

The team is still facing challenges in acquiring the proper test data for writing BDD scenarios. Given this, I’d like to propose a plan for the next sprint that ensures we continue progressing effectively.
Options for Next Sprint:

    Shift Focus to Development Work: We could take on more development tasks, such as InterFI LOB or pending development in the DDA-to-DDA flow. This would help maintain productivity while the test data issues are being resolved.

    Proceed with Testing Stories Using Mock Data: If we decide to continue with the testing stories, the team will test locally using mock data for now.

Options for Addressing Test Data Challenges:

While we work to get a dedicated resource for assisting with test data, I’ve outlined two potential solutions:

    Configure Virtual Data Using Service Virtualization Portal:
        We will require support from the backend (BE) team to configure the necessary endpoints and map our feature environment with the Service Virtualization Portal.
    Engage with TDMP Team:
        The team can connect with the TDMP team to learn how to use the utility for tweaking the data to fit our test logic requirements, allowing us to integrate this into our BDD test scripts.

Please let me know your thoughts on the proposed approach and if there are any preferences or additional considerations we should account for. We are committed to finding the best way forward to support our development and testing needs efficiently.

Really appreciate the strong technical expertise you bring, especially in UI automation—it’s been a big asset for the team. The way you implemented the multiRemote testing feature in the BDD application was impressive. It was a tough task, but you pulled it off so smoothly. Also, thanks a lot for helping me with the UI automation framework upgrade—your support made it much easier. And I truly enjoyed the time we spent together in Bengaluru working side by side. It was a great example of peer programming at its best!

**Subject:** Backlog and Feature Implementation Confirmation  

Dear [PO's Name],  

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring up a few important points that require your attention and input:  

1. **Backlog Status**  
   The current backlog appears to have very few stories, and I wanted to highlight this as a concern. As we approach the next sprint, I am uncertain about what the team will be picking up. Could you please share your thoughts or plans for addressing this?  

2. **Confirmation of Feature Completion**  
   Regarding the DDA to DDA flow, as per my knowledge, all the features for which stories were created have been completed, except for:  
   - A few error scenarios that still need to be implemented (we are waiting for a comprehensive list of these error scenarios).  
   - Validation of all entry points from where users can land on the transfer application (we are awaiting a complete list of these scenarios for testing).  

   Could you please clarify how you plan to confirm that all the required features from the legacy application have been implemented? Specifically, what will serve as the source of truth to validate this completeness?  

3. **New Features in Legacy Application**  
   There are features currently being implemented in the legacy application. Could you outline your plan for integrating these new features into the React application? Are we planning to create stories to track the addition of these new features to ensure alignment between the two systems?  

Your guidance on these points will be greatly appreciated, as it will help the team maintain clarity and ensure we are aligned with the overall goals.  

I have kept [Manager's Name] and [Scrum Master's Name] in CC for visibility.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Position]

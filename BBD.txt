Update on Scrum Workload

Hi [Manager's Name],

As discussed, I reconnected with the other leads to confirm the current workload across scrums. While earlier conversations suggested that several scrums were light on work, most leads have now confirmed they currently have active items in progress.

At this point, only the Transfers scrum, which Iâ€™m leading, remains without significant work.

Let me know if you'd like a detailed summary.

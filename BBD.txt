Problem Statement:
This code was written because multiple cases were reported in the native WebView where users encountered a blank screen. Even Glassbox was unable to capture this event, preventing the platform team from logging and diagnosing the issue effectively.

Proposed Solution:
To detect and address blank screen issues in WebView, we implemented JavaScript injection at the native level for both iOS and Android. This decision was made because adding JavaScript at the web application level would not be effective. If the issue originates from the backend (such as JSP rendering failures), the JavaScript would never reach execution, making it impossible to capture such failures. By injecting the script at the native level, we ensure that blank screens can be detected regardless of whether the issue occurs in the frontend or backend, allowing us to capture logs and alert the platform team accordingly.

Perceived Benefits
Enhanced Debugging: Allows the platform team to detect blank screens and capture relevant logs for analysis.

Improved User Experience: Helps in identifying and resolving blank screen issues proactively, reducing user frustration.

Cross-Platform Support: Works on both iOS and Android without requiring changes to the web application.

Better Monitoring: Enables Glassbox or other monitoring tools to log such occurrences, aiding in troubleshooting and fixing issues faster.

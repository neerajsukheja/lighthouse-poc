Hi [Manager's Name],

The team has finalized the approach for reverse engineering the jQuery-based application. We will be:

    Exploring the web app with different test data for each LOB and capturing observations.
    Reviewing the code only for the business logic tested in the UI, without deep analysis. We will also identify any flags used in the code for specific scenarios.
    Taking screenshots to help the business team understand requirements easily.

We acknowledge the following limitations:

    Our validation coverage depends on the available test data.
    Due to time constraints, we may not capture all validation scenarios in detail.

Please find the attached reverse engineering plan for your reference. Let us know if you have any feedback.

Best,
[Your Name]

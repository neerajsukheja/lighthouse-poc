Hi Karthik,

As per our earlier discussion, I wanted to understand the reasoning behind your team’s decision to delete the workspace after every Jenkins job. This approach is causing the npm install process to start from scratch each time, which takes around 40-50 minutes.

From my side, I’ve tested an alternative where the workspace isn’t deleted, and instead, we add a logic to only run npm install if there is any change in the package.json or package-lock.json files. This effectively omits the need to install node packages every time, bringing down the overall time required to run the BDD scripts in Jenkins.

In my testing, this change has been working smoothly and has significantly improved the total job runtime. I believe this could be a valuable optimization, and I’d like to hear your thoughts on the current setup and if we can explore this approach further.

Looking forward to your feedback.
